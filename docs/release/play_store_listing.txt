Full Description (4000 chars max):
HabitLoop is a minimal daily habit app where users commit to one simple action per day and track their consistency through a clean, reliable streak counter.

HabitLoop is designed around a single philosophy: Focus on what matters. Multi-tasking destroys momentum. By limiting your focus to one core habit at a time, you build lasting identity changes through simple daily repetition.

Features:
- Set one specific daily action (e.g., "Read for 10 minutes", "Drink water")
- Tap to mark your daily goal as Completed
- Maintain and grow your daily streak
- View a simple history timeline of your progress
- Fully local storage ensuring 100% privacy
- Dark mode support built-in

There are no accounts, no cloud tracking, and no complicated systems. Just you and your single daily goal.

One habit. Every day.
